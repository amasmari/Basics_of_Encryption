# Basics_of_Encryption
An implemention of introductory ElGamal and RSA encryption schemes

If you are familiar with the topic but need a refresher would recomend the wiki pages of these schemes
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)

If you are new then feel free to find any intro cryptography course as this is not a prefect educational material
